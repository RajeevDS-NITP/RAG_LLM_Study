# RAG_LLM_Study

🚀 Pathway to Master Gen AI, RAG, and LLMs
📌 Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 Weeks)
✅ Understand Core Concepts

What is Generative AI?
How do LLMs (Large Language Models) work?
Basics of Tokenization, Embeddings, Attention Mechanisms
Difference between Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering
Intro to Vector Databases (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
✅ Hands-on Practice

Setup FastAPI for backend APIs
Use Streamlit to create simple Gen AI-powered apps
Test OpenAI's GPT models via API calls
🎯 Mini Project:

A chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT models with Streamlit UI
📌 Phase 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (3-4 Weeks)
✅ Learn RAG Architecture

What is RAG, and why do we need it?
Understanding Vector Search & Semantic Retrieval
Using LangChain for retrieval workflows
✅ Hands-on Practice

Implement document ingestion (PDFs, CSVs, websites)
Use FAISS or ChromaDB for vector storage
Connect FastAPI & Streamlit for a full-stack app
🎯 Mini Project:

A RAG-powered QA system for document search
📌 Phase 3: Graph RAG & Advanced Retrieval (3-4 Weeks)
✅ Learn Graph RAG Concepts

How Graph Databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB) enhance RAG
Connecting entities & relationships in a knowledge graph
Querying graph databases with LLMs
✅ Hands-on Practice

Store text-based knowledge in GraphDB
Implement retrieval using Graph-based embeddings
Optimize results using hybrid search (Graph + Vector)
🎯 Mini Project:

A Graph-powered Q&A bot for legal/finance/HR documents
📌 Phase 4: Agentic AI (4-5 Weeks)
✅ Learn About Autonomous Agents

What are AI Agents?
Using LangChain Agents & AutoGPT
Multi-step reasoning & planning
✅ Hands-on Practice

Implement Task-Specific AI Agents
Create Agent-based automation workflows
Experiment with Agent Memory (long-term context retention)
🎯 Mini Project:

A Task Automation AI Agent (e.g., auto-reply email assistant)
📌 Phase 5: End-to-End Gen AI App (Production Ready)
✅ Build a Real-World AI Product

Integrate FastAPI + Streamlit + RAG + Agents
Optimize performance & cost for scaling
Deploy on AWS/GCP with CI/CD
🎯 Final Capstone Project:

A Full-fledged AI-powered Knowledge Assistant
🔥 Parallel Learning: Streamlit + FastAPI
Should we learn Streamlit & FastAPI parallelly?
✅ Yes! You should start building simple apps in Streamlit and API endpoints in FastAPI from Day 1. This will help you visualize & experiment with Gen AI concepts as you learn.
